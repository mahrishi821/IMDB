 tch   ky karyo   comes as a complete surprise to him    but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back    he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton s apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them    suddenly anton s ex maggie shows up   but she does not want her former lover back    on the contrary   all she wants to do is vaporize him    she may say that she doesn t want to kill him   but the possibility doesn t bother her too much either    after all   people die every day    in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on    the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times    but we haven t    griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since   while you where sleeping      the camera obscura adds a   special something   to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy    everything about the movie is perfect   from set design to casting    the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite    meg ryan   known from   when harry met sally   or   sleepless in seattle     surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image    she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl    even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her   much more so than in last years   courage under fire   where she played a gulf war pilot    matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality    the viewer can tell that he doesn t only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them    he has trouble keeping in touch with reality    after all   who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love    his naivet   that we don t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge    she would do anything to harm anton    she doesn t hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them    that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed   have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier    tch   ky karyo is perfect as anton    he is   well   repulsive    that s all there is to say about him    you can t really manage to pity him   even after all his mishaps    he not only took sam s bride away from him   he is also a french chef    worlds collide   i    e    the usa and france    this can only go wrong    even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking   you just can t sympathize with a man who plays   je t aime       moi  non plus   on his tape deck    not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for    sam certainly isn t    too bad for anton    for him things take a turn to the worse       addicted to love   is one of this year s most pleasant surprises    \",\n          \" bruce willis and sixth sense director m   night shyamalan re team to tell the story of david dunne   willis     a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child    on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job   dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of    to make things even stranger   dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed    a comic book art dealer named elijah price   samuel l   jackson     who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly   has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life    price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him        someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break    price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child    dunne doesn t believe him at first   but price assists him in discovering his   powers   and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is    writer/director m   night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense    how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years    for shyamalan   the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners    does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash   though    the answer to that question is not a very easy one   either    as far as pacing goes   the sixth sense seemed almost interminable    it wasn t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally   and perfectly   paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached    for unbreakable   shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which   in many ways   blows away the film that had come before    the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan s direction is excellent   with the camera almost constantly moving    there are tons of great shots in the film   not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis  character and another train passenger    the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak    also very impressive is the film s score by james newton howard   who also scored shyamalan s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes   as well as this year s dinosaur      several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film    one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to   exercise   his powers    the music   in combination with the stellar visuals   really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie    if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year   this one would be it    the film also boasts some great performances   including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment    willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne   who just can t seem to figure out why he s been depressed for the last few years    his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him   but he eventually grows into his own under elijah s tutelage    jackson is one of the better actors of our time   and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah    though his hairstyle is absurd   jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked    robin wright penn s role seems slightly underwritten   but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again    spencer treat clark   as the dunne s young son jeremy   shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors   and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film    out of all the characters   jeremy s is perhaps the most emotional   and clark does a great job with the role    where the film does lose points though   is during its   surprise   ending    shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense   but i found myself saying   that was it   !    when unbreakable revealed its own ending    it s not that the ending is bad   it s just that the ending doesn t quite have the emotional punch that the other film s did    plus   it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels   and i won t reveal the ending here   but you ll understand what i mean when you see it      essentially   what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable    the only real problem is that the ending doesn t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor    as long as it isn t held to the standard that sixth sense set   which it ultimately will be     it should be a remarkably well liked film    one thing seems clear   though    shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film    \",\n          \"    the end of the affair   is a dark and moody romantic period piece   that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs    although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow   it still manages to give audiences a moving experience    based on graham greene s novel of the same name   the film mainly follows 3 characters    there s maurice bendrix   ralph fiennes   who has an affair with henry mile s   stephen rea   wife sarah   julianne moore      sarah finds henry to be a bore   because well   he s just a normal guy    it s all work and no play with him    while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah   and would do anything for her    unfortunately the two break up    this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks   so that leads us to the present    it s a few years later   and they both still think of each other   so maurice hires a private detective   ian hart   to see what sarah is up too    while this may sound straight forward it s not    it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men   unhappiness   and the ever lasting love    all this may sound like a drag   but it really captures your interest    with great performances by ralph fiennes   doing another english patient type of film   only this movie is better   and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999   i believe this was the role   she had the most passion for   and you can see why    the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan    even though i didn t read the book   there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive    what s so moving about it you ask    the tragedy of it all    it s not the typical romance   in which a guy finds a girl   they fall in love and all is well   this is more complicated and depressing    it really shows the complexity of a relationship   because nothing is ever perfect    everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces    back to neil jordan s script   it wasn t only red roses    there were times when i felt it too be a little slow   but most romances are    it also tended to be a bit confusing   especially at the start    it keep jumping around from past to present   so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things    also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan    i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date   because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par    it just never did anything for me   until now    when it ends   it leaves viewers a little saddened   but provoked nonetheless    this is definitely one of the best films of 99   and had some of the best acting   most notably by moore    not for all movie goers   but for those who are film buffs and want something of value    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

is an astronomer in a small american town and engaged to teacher linda   kelly preston      he is head over heels in love and lindas sudden departure to new york city to live with her new lover anton   tch   ky karyo   comes as a complete surprise to him    but as we all know love is blind and so sam leaves for new york as well to win her back    he moves into an abandoned house across the street from anton s apartment and installs a camera obscura to watch them    suddenly anton s ex maggie shows up   but she does not want her former lover back    on the contrary   all she wants to do is vaporize him    she may say that she doesn t want to kill him   but the possibility doesn t bother her too much either    after all   people die every day    in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on    the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times    but we haven t    griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since   while you where sleeping      the camera obscura adds a   special something   to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy    everything about the movie is perfect   from set design to casting    the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite    meg ryan   known from   when harry met sally   or   sleepless in seattle     surprises in a role that may finally help her get rid of her sweet little girl image    she impresses the viewer as a maneating biker girl    even more surprising is the fact that the viewer believes her   much more so than in last years   courage under fire   where she played a gulf war pilot    matthew broderick is the goodnatured and somewhat naive sam who has trouble accepting reality    the viewer can tell that he doesn t only watch the stars but also tries to reach out for them    he has trouble keeping in touch with reality    after all   who would leave everything behind to chase a lost love    his naivet   that we don t question for a minute throughout the movie clashes with maggies exaggerated wish for revenge    she would do anything to harm anton    she doesn t hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them    that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed   have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier    tch   ky karyo is perfect as anton    he is   well   repulsive    that s all there is to say about him    you can t really manage to pity him   even after all his mishaps    he not only took sam s bride away from him   he is also a french chef    worlds collide   i    e    the usa and france    this can only go wrong    even if maggies revenge schemes are at times shocking   you just can t sympathize with a man who plays   je t aime       moi  non plus   on his tape deck    not everyone is captured by the french charme that linda and even maggie fell for    sam certainly isn t    too bad for anton    for him things take a turn to the worse       addicted to love   is one of this year s most pleasant surprises    \",\n          \" bruce willis and sixth sense director m   night shyamalan re team to tell the story of david dunne   willis     a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child    on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job   dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of    to make things even stranger   dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed    a comic book art dealer named elijah price   samuel l   jackson     who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly   has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life    price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him        someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break    price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child    dunne doesn t believe him at first   but price assists him in discovering his   powers   and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is    writer/director m   night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense    how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years    for shyamalan   the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners    does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash   though    the answer to that question is not a very easy one   either    as far as pacing goes   the sixth sense seemed almost interminable    it wasn t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally   and perfectly   paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached    for unbreakable   shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which   in many ways   blows away the film that had come before    the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan s direction is excellent   with the camera almost constantly moving    there are tons of great shots in the film   not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis  character and another train passenger    the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak    also very impressive is the film s score by james newton howard   who also scored shyamalan s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes   as well as this year s dinosaur      several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film    one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to   exercise   his powers    the music   in combination with the stellar visuals   really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie    if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year   this one would be it    the film also boasts some great performances   including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment    willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne   who just can t seem to figure out why he s been depressed for the last few years    his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him   but he eventually grows into his own under elijah s tutelage    jackson is one of the better actors of our time   and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah    though his hairstyle is absurd   jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked    robin wright penn s role seems slightly underwritten   but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again    spencer treat clark   as the dunne s young son jeremy   shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors   and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film    out of all the characters   jeremy s is perhaps the most emotional   and clark does a great job with the role    where the film does lose points though   is during its   surprise   ending    shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense   but i found myself saying   that was it   !    when unbreakable revealed its own ending    it s not that the ending is bad   it s just that the ending doesn t quite have the emotional punch that the other film s did    plus   it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels   and i won t reveal the ending here   but you ll understand what i mean when you see it      essentially   what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable    the only real problem is that the ending doesn t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor    as long as it isn t held to the standard that sixth sense set   which it ultimately will be     it should be a remarkably well liked film    one thing seems clear   though    shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film    \",\n          \"    the end of the affair   is a dark and moody romantic period piece   that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs    although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow   it still manages to give audiences a moving experience    based on graham greene s novel of the same name   the film mainly follows 3 characters    there s maurice bendrix   ralph fiennes   who has an affair with henry mile s   stephen rea   wife sarah   julianne moore      sarah finds henry to be a bore   because well   he s just a normal guy    it s all work and no play with him    while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah   and would do anything for her    unfortunately the two break up    this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks   so that leads us to the present    it s a few years later   and they both still think of each other   so maurice hires a private detective   ian hart   to see what sarah is up too    while this may sound straight forward it s not    it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men   unhappiness   and the ever lasting love    all this may sound like a drag   but it really captures your interest    with great performances by ralph fiennes   doing another english patient type of film   only this movie is better   and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999   i believe this was the role   she had the most passion for   and you can see why    the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan    even though i didn t read the book   there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive    what s so moving about it you ask    the tragedy of it all    it s not the typical romance   in which a guy finds a girl   they fall in love and all is well   this is more complicated and depressing    it really shows the complexity of a relationship   because nothing is ever perfect    everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces    back to neil jordan s script   it wasn t only red roses    there were times when i felt it too be a little slow   but most romances are    it also tended to be a bit confusing   especially at the start    it keep jumping around from past to present   so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things    also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan    i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date   because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par    it just never did anything for me   until now    when it ends   it leaves viewers a little saddened   but provoked nonetheless    this is definitely one of the best films of 99   and had some of the best acting   most notably by moore    not for all movie goers   but for those who are film buffs and want something of value    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n

either    after all   people die every day    in spite of their different motives the two team up and fall for each other as things move on    the story sounds like something we all have seen a million times    but we haven t    griffin dunne brings us the most charming comedy since   while you where sleeping      the camera obscura adds a   special something   to the movie and makes it an exceptional romantic comedy    everything about the movie is perfect   from set design to casting    the dialogues are inspired and the touches of black humor add a certain bite    meg ryan   known

would do anything to harm anton    she doesn t hesitate to use sam for her plan and makes him understand right from the beginning that nothing will happen between the two of them    that makes the scenes when they innocently share a bed   have potatoe chips and watch the action across the street like a saturday night show on tv even funnier    tch   ky karyo is perfect as anton    he is   well

  a stadium security guard who has been having some problems at home that are affecting his relationship with his wife and child    on a return trip from new york where he was trying to get a job   dunne is in a horrible train accident that he is the only survivor of    to make things even stranger   dunne has also escaped the accident completely unscathed    a comic book art dealer named elijah price   samuel l   jackson     who was born with a degenerative bone disease that causes his bones to be so brittle that they break constantly   has been seeking out someone like dunne his entire life    price felt that there had to be someone exactly the opposite of him        someone whose bones would be so strong that they would never break    price contacts dunne and convinces him to come down to his gallery for a talk where he suggests that dunne could quite possibly be something akin to a superhero from the comic books price used to read when he was a child    dunne doesn t believe him at first   but price assists him in discovering his   powers   and helps him hone his craft until he discovers what his true calling really is    writer/director m   night shyamalan had a tough act to follow with his sleeper hit the sixth sense    how exactly does one follow up on one of the biggest and most popular thrillers in recent years    for shyamalan   the answer must have come as easy to him as nuclear physics does to kindergartners    does this new film measure up to his breakthrough box office smash   though    the answer to that question is not a very easy one   either    as far as pacing goes   the sixth sense seemed almost interminable    it wasn t until the surprise ending was revealed that i realized the film was actually intentionally   and perfectly   paced in order to give the audience ample time to re connect all of the information they had seen once the climax had been reached    for unbreakable   shyamalan gave the film a much more satisfying pace which   in many ways   blows away the film that had come before    the story moves along at a steady pace and shyamalan s direction is excellent   with the camera almost constantly moving    there are tons of great shots in the film   not least of which is a conversation that opens the film between willis  character and another train passenger    the shot seems as though it were filmed like we were watching the two talk from between the train seats and the camera steadily glides back and forth between the two actors as they speak    also very impressive is the film s score by james newton howard   who also scored shyamalan s sixth sense and the similar film stir of echoes   as well as this year s dinosaur      several of the scenes are driven by a very catchy beat and help to increase the tempo of the film    one of the best examples of this is a scene in which dunne goes into a train station to   exercise   his powers    the music   in combination with the stellar visuals   really go a long way towards making this an incredible movie    if there was any one soundtrack i would make a must purchase this year   this one would be it    the film also boasts some great performances   including a precocious child actor trying to vie for the oscar throne left vacant by haley joel osment    willis turns in a great performance as the sad sack dunne   who just can t seem to figure out why he s been depressed for the last few years    his character almost seems pathetic when we first meet him   but he eventually grows into his own under elijah s tutelage    jackson is one of the better actors of our time   and here he turns in yet another great performance as the ever injured elijah    though his hairstyle is absurd   jackson seems to infuse such a great deal of pain into his role that the mortar board hairdo can easily be overlooked    robin wright penn s role seems slightly underwritten   but she still manages to get across the intense hurt of her character s need for love from her husband and her desire to make things work again    spencer treat clark   as the dunne s young son jeremy   shows that shyamalan still has a knack for picking young actors   and he turns in one of the most competent performances in the film    out of all the characters   jeremy s is perhaps the most emotional   and clark does a great job with the role    where the film does lose points though   is during its   surprise   ending    shyamalan has said in interviews that he was going to do an ending that blew away the one presented by the sixth sense   but i found myself saying   that was it   !    when unbreakable revealed its own ending    it s not that the ending is bad   it s just that the ending doesn t quite have the emotional punch that the other film s did    plus   it almost seems like it sets itself up for sequels   and i won t reveal the ending here   but you ll understand what i mean when you see it      essentially   what all of this means is that shyamalan has made another good film with unbreakable    the only real problem is that the ending doesn t quite fill the shadow left by its predecessor    as long as it isn t held to the standard that sixth sense set   which it ultimately will be     it should be a remarkably well liked film    one thing seems clear   though    shyamalan definitely has an affinity for comic books that he would like to share with the world and many comic book fans will also delight the vision he presents in this film    \",\n          \"    the end of the affair   is a dark and moody romantic period piece   that neil jordan exquisitely writes and directs    although it s slow and sometimes confusing to follow   it still manages to give audiences a moving experience    based on graham greene s novel of the same name   the film mainly follows 3 characters    there s maurice bendrix   ralph fiennes   who has an affair with henry mile s   stephen rea   wife sarah   julianne moore      sarah finds henry to be a bore   because well   he s just a normal guy    it s all work and no play with him    while maurice on the other hand falls madly in love with sarah   and would do anything for her    unfortunately the two break up    this is all witnessed in a serious of flashbacks   so that leads us to the present    it s a few years later   and they both still think of each other   so maurice hires a private detective   ian hart   to see what sarah is up too    while this may sound straight forward it s not    it s a deep dark tale of the jealousy that lies in the two men   unhappiness   and the ever lasting love    all this may sound like a drag   but it really captures your interest    with great performances by ralph fiennes   doing another english patient type of film   only this movie is better   and julianna moore who definitely deserves an oscar because out of all 5 films she did in 1999   i believe this was the role   she had the most passion for   and you can see why    the story was also well written thanks to neil jordan    even though i didn t read the book   there s no doubt in mind that it was just as moving and descriptive    what s so moving about it you ask    the tragedy of it all    it s not the typical romance   in which a guy finds a girl   they fall in love and all is well   this is more complicated and depressing    it really shows the complexity of a relationship   because nothing is ever perfect    everyone feels a different way and that is what tears us to pieces    back to neil jordan s script   it wasn t only red roses    there were times when i felt it too be a little slow   but most romances are    it also tended to be a bit confusing   especially at the start    it keep jumping around from past to present   so it obviously took awhile to get a grasp of things    also a notable was the superb direction by neil jordan    i d have to say this is his finest achievement to date   because quite frankly i ve never really found his work to be up to par    it just never did anything for me   until now    when it ends   it leaves viewers a little saddened   but provoked nonetheless    this is definitely one of the best films of 99   and had some of the best acting   most notably by moore    not for all movie goers   but for those who are film buffs and want something of value    \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\":
